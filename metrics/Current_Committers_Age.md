# {Current Committers Age}

Question: How long have contributors belonged to a community?

## Description
The Current Committers Age metric is the differenve between the first commit of those contributors who have committed in the past serveral months and the date of their first commit. While the amount of time someone has spent with a project does not necessarily indicate their importance to the project, it may be helpful to know the age of a community and if there are consistently new contributors. This metric can be displayed over time, indicating rises and falls in the number of new vs old contributors over time. A high number of old contributors might be valuable because they have experience with a project and it shows the value of retention. However, without a significant number of new contributors, it could mean that the project is slowing to a halt. This metric is distinct from the Committers metric in that, while a large number of committers is a good measure of activity, businesses may want to know the number of veterans there are to run/organize new activity.

## Objectives
Answer the question for why someone wants to measure this metric and what can be known with it.

## Implementation
Provide details on how to measure the metric, collect the data, and analyze it. The following sub-headings are optional but help to structure the different aspects of implementation.

### Visualizations (optional)
Include visualizations such as screenshot of the metric. There may be many more visualizations for this metric, we only want to provide a flavor for what this metric is about.

### Tools Providing the Metric (optional)
Metric must be currently deployed/available, in contrast to a tool having the "potential" to provide the metric. Provide direct link to implementation/documentation, if applicable

### Data Collection Strategies (Optional)
If there are several different ways to collect data for this metric, list them here.
This may include expressing a metric in different ways.
