# Current Committers Age

Question: How long have contributors belonged to a community?

## Description
The Current Committers Age metric is the difference between the first commit of those contributors who have committed in the past serveral months and the date of their first commit. While the amount of time someone has spent with a project does not necessarily indicate their importance to the project, it may be helpful to know the age of a community and if there are consistently new contributors. This metric can be displayed over time, indicating rises and falls in the number of new vs old contributors over time. A high number of old contributors might be valuable because they have experience with a project and it shows the value of retention. However, without a significant number of new contributors, it could mean that the project is slowing to a halt. This metric is distinct from the Committers metric in that, while a large number of committers is a good measure of activity, businesses may want to know the number of veterans there are to run/organize new activity.

## Objectives
Project managers looking for open source projects to use in their own work may find the average current committers age useful. The measure may not directly correlate to the health of a project, but a large number of long time contributors in addition to more recent contributors could signify good health. Long time contributors of projects are more likely to have more experience with a project and be a valid resource for newer contributors. A project with these qualities may indicate a stronger future which is an attractive attribute for potential investors and uses.

## Implementation
Using the Committers metric and gathering unique users from the past several months (or whatever period of time is deemed most effective) and searching for their first commit to the project. Averaging this accross all users or displaying this information graphically could provide a snapshot of the current state of the project and give insight into its future.

## Known Issues with Data Quality
Just because a contributor committed long ago as well as recently it does not mean that they have been consistent contributors throughout this time.
